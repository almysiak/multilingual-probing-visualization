from the AP come this story :

the sheikh in wheel - chair have be attack with a f - 16 - launch bomb .
he could be kill year ago and the Israelian have all the reason , since he found and he be the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they _ .
_ incident prove that Sharon have lose he patience and he hope in peace .
nervous people make mistake , so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull Arab attack .
a la guerre c'est comme a la guerre !
in the eastern city of Baqubah , guerrilla detonate a car bomb outside a police station , kill several people .
the US lose yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew be safe .
in Fallujah , hundred of demonstrator come out against US troops when they briefly arrest a yound newlywed bride .
( I hope that the US army get a enormous amount of information from she relative , because otherwise this move be a bad , bad tradeoff ) .
the US troops fire into the hostile crowd , kill 4 .
it seem clear to I that the manhunt for high Baath official in the Sunni heartland be be do wrong , or at least in way that be bad for US standing with local Iraqi .
Google have finally have a analyst day -- a chance to present the _ story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who _ hear it .
usually , this be just a chance for the suckup to suck up , but this time people be actually concerned about the _ plan .
they work on Wall Street , after all , so when they hear a company whose state goal include " _ be evil , " they imagine a company whose eventually history will be " _ be profitable . "
_ not quite as freewheeling a environment as _ imagine : Sergey Brin have actually create a mathematical ' proof ' that the _ self - drive research strategy , which give employee one day a week to do research project on they own , be a good , respectable idea .
read the entire article ; _ a punchline , too .
my opinion piece on the implication of _ passing for al - Qaeda have appear at Newsday .
excerpt :
" _ secular nationalism be supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiation remain rocky .
the continue Israeli colonization of the occupy Palestinian territory during the 1990 help , along with terrorist attack by radical group such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon have always oppose .
_ death create a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be fill .
_ assassination of major Hamas leader have also weaken authority structure in that party .
if the Israeli and the Palestinian leadership _ find a way to reinvigorate the peace process , cell of radical young Palestinian may grow up that look to bin Laden for they cue .
even if local Palestinian leader remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the fester Israeli - Palestinian struggle remain among the good recruiting poster for al - Qaida with young Muslim man .
resolve this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United State could deploy in its war on terror . "
Xinhua report that a wide range of Iraqi political force on Tuesday condemn _ murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a religious leader of Hamas , the day before .
the board of Muslim cleric in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , " condemn the assassination and promise immediate revenge against the coalition soldier in Iraq . "
Ash - Sharq al - Awsat report that Fallujah be close Tuesday in a general strike .
US troops there clash with guerrilla in a fight that leave one Iraqi dead .
in Ramadi , there be a big demonstration .
radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr say the attack be " criminal " and that " the Zionist have leave only one choice for the Arab , that of fighting and jihad " .
the interim Govern Council issue a communique say , " it be a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavor in the region . . .
this operation would only consolidate the terrorist act in the world and would not bring peace to the region , " the message claim .
Xinhua allege that " many of the Iraqi , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate they case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation . "
in a apparently unrelated incident , some eleven Iraqi be kill by sniper on Tuesday , include a group of police trainee in a bus near Hilla and two police in Kirkuk .
ever since the first whisper about _ ipo , most investor have fear that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that , even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution , the price would be too high for investor to make a real profit .
_ move on .
_ grow up .
now , people wonder if Google can even survive .
_ overstate it , I know .
what they wonder be whether Google can be anything more than what _ always be -- a great search engine with some real grass - root support , successful by the grace of simplicity .
simplicity give it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - base ad , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
the problem be that customer attract by a simple interface be among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - few - feature between low - end camera company .
the other problem ?
_ tough to make money branch out when you appeal be in you focus .
as the survey cite in the above - link article show , most Google user _ intend to use Gmail , and Google _ even as popular as Yahoo! and AOL .
if they continue to add feature so they can justify they likely sky - high valuation , Google risk lose a huge chunk of they customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
remember when a whole lot of people have to die because a Swedish newspaper print that cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed ?
now Iran want to turn the table and be invite cartoonist to do they good by depict the Holocaust .
amazingly , this idiot think a cartoon of Mohammed be comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
TEHRAN ( AFP ) -
a international contest of cartoon on the Holocaust open in Tehran in response to the publication in western paper last September of caricature of the Prophet Mohammed .
" we stage this fair to explore the limit of freedom Westerner believe in , " Masoud Shojai , head of the _ " Iran Cartoon " association and the fair organizer , say .
" they can freely write anything they like about we prophet , but if one raise doubt about the Holocaust he be either fine or send to prison , " he add .
" though we do not deny that fact that Jew be kill in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinian pay for it ? "
Shojai tell the open ceremony of the month - long fair in _ Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
he add that around 1100 cartoon be submit by participant from more than 60 country and that more than 200 be on show .
he say the top three cartoon will be announce on September 2 , with the winner be award prize of 12000 , 8000 and 5000 dollar respectively .
this cute little stunt be only go to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslim be .
when they see a cartoon of they prophet , people have to die .
when they precious cartoon be release I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
US Marine move into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they be still meet pocket of resistance .
the Fallujah fighting have kill fair number of Iraqi noncombatant , include Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respect Association of Muslim Scholar .
armed clash break out in several northern Iraqi city on Wednesday , leave some 22 person dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz .
hundred of person mount demonstration against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , accord to az - Zaman .
the battle and demonstration be provoke by the US assault on Fallujah .
guerrilla threaten to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
_ aged cousin and the _ wife and daughter - in - law be abduct and guerrilla threaten to behead they if the Fallujah compaign be not stop .
in Iraqi society , PM Allawi be responsible for protect he clan , include especially he first cousin , so this kidnapping make he look weak and bring substantial shame on he .
the US Marine take most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pocket of resistance .
if Samarra and other city be any guide , that pocket of resistance could go on bedevil the US for some time to come .
the intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT have more on the Sunni boycott of the election .
he report that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which have early be absolutely commit to get out the Sunni vote , be now waver and say they position will depend on the situation .
the outbreak of demonstration and violence throughout the Sunni Arab region on Wednesday do not bode well for Sunni participation in the January election .

for some black satire on Fallujah , see Unconfirmed Source which have some fun with my Weblog .
[ be at a conference and _ blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of day . ]
the hot item on Christmas wish list this year be nuclear weapon .
Al - Qaeda want they , Iran want they , Russia want the good one , and all the US want be to give they all a piece of coal .
for the last few year there have be tension with _ nuclear program with word come this week that a deal be reach through the European Union that meet with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
at the same time , a Iranian opposition group release what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapon program .
aerial photo , loose connection to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group present .
Russia also announce that it be seek and build the good nuke the _ ever see .
President Vladimir Putin say Russia be will have new nuclear weapon that other country do not and will not have .
with the demand so high , the question arise on to who should be or have the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapon .
right now that seem to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
but not always do that three agree , and not always be they decision equal .
the US have strongly oppose a nuclear weapon program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day have never officially say that they poss nuclear weapon , rank around fifth in nuclear strength .
it be estimate that Israel have over 200 nuclear weapon yet neither the US nor any of she ally express the slight concern .
North _ Kim Jong Ill also have the bomb at the top of he list and Santa seem to have already come a few year ago .
it be rumor that North Korea have at least a couple nuclear weapon .
but get past who should get they , be who have they , and who be really close .
the case against Iran have a feeling of déjà vu .
aerial photo of the lab where uranium be be enrich , somewhat like that of chemical weapon stockpile in Iraq .
America cry wolf in Iraq , and _ scary be that soon or late , that wolf will probably get we .
I run across this item on the internet .
so .
the United State go into a war zone and evacuate a bunch of U.S. citizen ( most of whom be " dual - citizen " ) .
then , eschew normal procedure , the Department of State waive the fee that they charge for evacuate U.S. citizen .
why ?
to pander to the mythical " Arab street " , of course .
now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predict that some form of military violence be likely to occur in Lebanon ( consider that the country have be experience some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 year ) .
in other word , that American be there by they own choice , mire in a situation that be totally predictable .
yet we _ charge they for the evacuation .
this be unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuate U.S. citizen from area that be hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that be much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoke destruction that rain down on Lebanon .
and what do we get for this effort ?
a lawsuit .
_ right , folks .
the American - Arab Discrimination Committee be sue Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charge that they mismanage the evacuation effort .
_ a excerpt from the article :
Nina Chahine , 19 , who with she family be among the name plaintiff in the lawsuit , say she wedding in the southern city of Tyre be set for July 13 .
the wedding have to be postpone as family member flee the outbreak of the war , she say .
" we be on the road and the first bridge be bomb and we drive home and all the other bridge be bomb and there be absolutely no way for we to get home , " Chahine tell reporter outside federal court in Detroit .
" we be all American citizen and there be no way that anybody help we .
no communication nothing .
I be on my way to my wedding fear death , basically . "
Chahine say she immediate family spend about $ 20000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan .
dear Nina ,
_ a tip : _ get marry in country that house illegal militia that attack other country and hence be likely to come under counter-attack !
crap like this sure make I want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemma of they own making .
though I be loathe to quote other writer at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan _ " White House Briefing " column in the WashPost today be just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ) :
at the ask the President event on Friday , one of the question be about whether Bush have any thought about he memoirs .
this be one example of what happen when Bush get a question that he _ anticipate .
" q thank you -- I be wonder , _ a lot of talk right now about memoirs be write with the former President .
after you be elect in 2004 , what will you memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
" the PRESIDENT : I appreciate that .
( laughter . )
there be a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all , I _ know .
_ just speculate now .
I really _ think about write a book .
my life be too complicated right now try to do my job .
( laughter . )
but if -- _ a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that show a horseman charge up a steep cliff , and there be at least two other horseman follow .
_ a western scene by a guy name W.H.S. Koerner call ' a Charge to keep . '
_ on loan , by the way , from a guy name Joe O'Neill in Midland , Texas .
he be the person , he and he wife Jan , introduce -- reintroduce I and Laura in he backyard in July of 1977 .
four month late , we be marry .
so _ get a -- _ a decision - maker and I can make good decision .
( applause . )
" and so we sing this hymn -- this be a long story try to get to you answer .
( laughter . )
this be not a filibuster .
( laughter . )
_ a Senate term -- particularly on good judge .
( applause . )
the hymn be sing at my first inaugural church service as governor .
Laura and I be Methodist .
one of the Wesley boy write the hymn .
the painting be base upon the hymn call , ' a Charge to keep . '
I have .
the hymn talk about serve something great than yourself in life .
I -- which I try to do , as well as I possibly can .
( applause . )
" the book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it be -- one of the theme would be , I be give a charge to keep .
and I give it all my heart , all my energy , base upon principle that do not change once I get into the Oval Office .
( applause . ) "
now _ a rambling response .
and I have to wonder : do he forget that he already have a memoir call " a Charge to keep " ?
that be the name of he " autobiography " -- ghost - write by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 .
there have be random speculation about Google develop a new browser and / or acquire Firefox .
it be true that Google have be in acquisition mode .
they have acquire Urchin , Zipdash , Apply Semantics , Picasa , Blogger , and satellite imaging company Keyhole , so why not Firefox ?
I have no inside information , but I have be follow link today that strongly indicate that Google be damn serious about secure permanent control of the lead edge browser technology in Firefox .
Ben Goodger be the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
he announce this in January :
as of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income change from the Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc. of Mountain View , California .
my role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue do much the same work as I have describe above - with the new goal of successful 1.1 , 1.5 and 2.0 release .
I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
he also announce this in January :
welcome Darin !
I just want to extend a big " welcome ! " to Darin Darin Fisher who join I at Google this week .
2005 be go to rock !
Darin Fisher write this response on January 25 , 2005 :
I and the big " G "
follow on the heel of _ annoucement yesterday , I think _ post that I have join Google as well .
like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)
post by darin
Ben make another announcement on March 28 , 2005 :
I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google !
Brian have be one of the most crucial element to the success of Mozilla software over the past few year , ...
great to have you on board !
now , none of this have be confirm by Google at the present time , but _ a old adage that you follow the money to see who be behind something .
in this case , follow the talent lead I to think that Google will be make a announcement this year that formalize the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship .
if you have not already see the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minute and view the future history of media as conceive by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
in this movie Google and Amazon ( GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008 .
this be one thought - provoke film .
every move Google make bring this particular future close .
just one small comment - _ not possible , as far as I know , for Google to " aquire " Firefox .
they already have rights to take it , alter it , and release that change to the world - this be what the whole open source thing be about .
_ inclined to say that google be do what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non-microsoft browser out there - by take on the lead light in Firefox development , _ ensure the continue life of the project , and ensure ( not that I think they need to ) that they voice will be hear amidst the high echelon of the firefox development team .
_ this sort of enlightened self interest that keep large open source project alive .
fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic .
thanks for the link .
Malach , what you say make sense .
acquire open source talent give a company a inexpensive way of influence and anticipate the direction a open source project will go .
it probably give more bang for the buck than acquire a private company and have to handle the inevitable culture clash and process mis-match .
the Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - _ movement only three month before the Coalition Provisional Authority go out of business have to be see as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
how do the CPA get to the point where it have turn even Iraqi Shiite , who be initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United State ?
where it risk fight dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgency simultaneously , at a time when US troops be rotate on a massive scale and hope to downsize they force in country ?
at a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingent be already committed to leave , and the UN be reluctant to get involved ?
one answer be that the Pentagon prevent the State Department from run the CPA .
State be the body with experience in international affair and administration .
the civilian in the Department of Defense only know how to blow thing up .
Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staff the CPA with neoconservative , most of whom have no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ) .
they actively exclude State Department Iraq hand like Tom Warrick .
( only recently have a few experienced State Department arabist be allow in to try to begin mop up the mess . )
the neocon in the CPA have all sort of ulterior motive and social experiment they want to impose on the Iraqi people , include Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even break the country up into three part .
the Washington _ _ who of Neocon in Iraq help explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who be close to the Bush administration , admit on Sept. 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War be to " protect Israel , " accord to the Asian Times .
I have long be a trenchant critic of the Sadrist .
but they _ be up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent week .
someone in the CPA sit down and think up way to stir they up by close they newspaper and issue 28 arrest warrant and take in people like Yaqubi .
this be either gross incompetence or be do with dark ulterior motive that can scarcely be guess at .
there be a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( z happen after x , therefore z be cause by x ) , and I keep revise this posting this evening because I _ want to fall into it .
but sometimes , of course , when z happen after x it be because of x .
so I may as well just come out with it : it be pretty suspicious , give the neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reach of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP report of Muqtada :
' a radical Shiite Muslim cleric have express solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and say that he should be consider the _ " striking arm " in Iraq .
" I have say and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah call for to stand with Hamas , " Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr say Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah .
last month , Nasrallah announce that he party would close rank with Hamas .
" let ( Hamas ) consider I they striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine be the same , " al - Sadr say during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , he home base south of Baghdad .
he do comment on what he mean by the phrase . '
and on April 3 he chief aide in Najaf be suddenly arrest along with 13 other member of he organization , and the Coalition force be put into violent conflict with he organization , which leave 7 US soldier dead .
the Army be unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoke it and why ?
_ not even in Iraq and I could have predict to you the consequence of do what the CPA have be do .
Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveal that the warrant for the arrest have be issue month before _ .
why be they suddenly act on Saturday ?
I be not go unless lisa promise to get all wasted and boob out .
I definitely could use a drink , actually a couple would probably do well .
Bryan , _ in , right ?
anybody up for happy hour after work ?
I be think _ at around 5 .
let I know
you _ know what that mean ?
where do you grow up ?
India ?
boob out ?
should I be embarrassed that I _ the slight idea what that mean ?
I be go out tonight to get wasted if anyone be interested .
jill allen finish she cpa today and she and she friend be go to party .
max and jen be look for you .
call they at 303-832-8160 .
they _ hear from you in a while .
work it into you speech -- something along the line of , " and Jen , you come from great people and have fantastic friend .
in fact Peder and I be remark on how agreeable they all be as they suck on we ball last night .

I have to go to butt - fuck mississippi .

I think they be all bark and no bite .
I think they could get they ass kick by cat .
they look like they be doberman pincher who be shrink .
you should get a cocker spaniel .

I want it because it be really small and cute .

why do you think they be mean ?

all :
it be my understanding , from good source in the _ office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all party authority to enter into direct access contract .
the premise with which the administartion be act be that if they expeditiously suspend _ right to bilateral contract quickly , it set up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
in other word the table be set .
deal you meal from where the dish be locate .
i.e. the Davis administration want to place all direct access advocate in the position of have to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concern how direct access should work for all party .
it clearly give the admin a very strong upper hand to control how when and where direct access can occur without have to say that they oppose direct access .
power be where power lie .
you _ go in for the wedding until Sunday now ?

on or about September 23 , 1999 a request for service be place by the above reference counterparty .
the request be for a intrastate gas transportation agreement and 311 gas transportation agreement .
this agreement be forward to the counterparty , CCNG , Inc. .

I be now model the Queensland electricity spot price use geometric brownian mean revert jump diffusion model and have follow you paper " make the most of mean reversion " to estimate the mean reversion speed .
I use Queensland half - hourly price during 13 December , 1998 - 30 June 2001 give about 44000 price observation .
however , the result from ordinary least square be not as expect due to different sign for both slope & intercept .
the coefficient and standard error be as follow :
intercept : - 0.3931 ( 0.0076 )
slope : 0.1171 ( 0.0022 )
r square : 0.0585
therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimate slope have the positive sign .
I have also try monthly data and the result be the same .
it would be appreciate if you could advice I on this matter .

several year ago I develop a short paper and pencil screening test which , in a small pilot study , discriminate between adhd , ld , and control subject .
I recently convert this test to a online test in order to norm it to a large population and , subsequently , to make it available to anyone _ who have access to a computer and the internet .
the test itself be what be call a substitution test .
it have two part , both of which be time for 90 seconds each and the differential between the result two score determine the likelihood of have a learning disability or attention deficit disorder .
I be in need of test subject and hope you will take it .
the test , along with a information form , be available at : .
I think a test like this one be much need .
a person can take it directly instead of other complete behavioral checklist or a complete a lengthy program intensive test like TOVA .
perhaps you be willing to recommend this site and , if you have a website , place a link on you website .
be there any sadist out there who share the same taste as I do ?
I _ know what it be , but since a very young age I have have a strange but very gratifying urge to torture or maime animal .
I be deadly serious , I really do get sexual relief from even hear of torture of animal , now some people may call I a brute or a coward but I _ help my true feeling .
badger baiting be naturally a huge turn on , so I think a few word in this group might uncover some mutual enthusiast .
sincere appology to anyone who be offend by my request but my request be genuine .

NASA intend upon retire the space shuttle in 2010 , which only leave it with 18 flight towards the ISS .
outsource this responsibility would be a wise alternative , consider the accomplishment of the private sector regard the space elevator .

normally this author be semi-objective ( what blogger be ) but on the seattlepi.com ( see source link ) Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas have demand that Israel leave all the land that it occupy before the 1967 border ( which include East Jerusalem by the way ) .
one thing be certain for sure .
if Abbas keep up this " macho talk " he will kill potential peace talk and might as well allow Hamas ( which have probably do a good job at provide for the Palestinian ) rule the West Bank .
AP photo / Nasser Nasser
interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan. 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talk during he first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday December 25 , 2004 .
cloak himself in Yasser _ legacy , Abbas pledge to fulfill Palestinian dream of statehood .
it seem that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
he be already demand claim that Israel say no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
list he priority , Abbas tell supporter of the rule Fatah party that he be determined to provide security to he people and continue the struggle against _ partially complete West Bank barrier .
Abbas also pledge to resolve the problem of million of Palestinian refugee and they descendant .
Abbas , a refugee himself from what be today the northern Israeli city of Safed , call the refugee issue " very important and very dangerous . "
have personally visit the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice be threaten to collapse the peace process .
if Abbas do not change he former thinking and continue the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinian will ultimately suffer .
Selah !

( hat tip : _ Quarters )
( BBC )
the Palestinian militant organisation Hamas have announce a end to rocket attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalate violence .
up to 40 rocket have be fire at Israel , week after its military withdraw from the territory .
in response to the rocket , Israel resume its policy of target militant leader in air strike .
authorise by Ariel Sharon to make " unrestricted " strike , its military launch new missile attack overnight .
it look as if Hamas have throw in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Force have unleash upon this terrorist group .
Mahmoud Zahar , _ leader declare the cease fire after Israel kill it former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
Hamas have become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strike as a response towards the rocket attack upon Israeli soil .
Egypt have a role to play as they convince Hamas to end the attack , although the same can not be say of Islamic Jihad .
( Jerusalem Post )
" _ not happy with _ position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinian , " comment Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official .
" but it seem that Hamas have its own political agenda . "
[ ... ]
" the problem be not with the Palestinian resistance group but with _ scheme to destroy the _ infrastructure , " Habib say .
" Hamas remain target by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation do not need excuse to pursue its aggression .
Israel want to drive the Palestinian toward civil war . "
Islamic Jihad have refuse to recognize the cease fire , and hope to turn the Gaza strip " into a vast battlefield . "
unless President Mahmoud Abbas step in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel be done remind Hamas of they critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas be do be lash out and refuse to take responsibility for he inability to act .

they be probably infertile .
if there be no male they be probably infertile !

if she have no male to fertilize the egg , the egg will aways be infertile .
if you do have a male but they be not in the same cage or breed but you touch he then she she will smell he sent and probably lay egg .
hope she stop lay egg because she will get really skinny !
if she continue !

_ a amazing experience !
be it good to book a cruise online or by a travel agent ?
first time to go on a cruise any and all info be appreciate
personally , I _ find a travel agent to be of value to I as I be willing to put in the time do research on the internet .
I have not have good experience with travel agent .
they _ seem to know anything but the hype they be tell and the package they have available to they .
the one time I actually book through a travel agent I do not get all of the amenity I have pay for .
the few time I have consult with a travel agent I be able to find the same for less on my own , and more option than what they be sell .
so now I do not bother with they at all .

my Hamster escape .... need help now !?

he be in my room , but there be so many thing inside there , I _ what to do .
I have lot of container in there .

can I have some indoor pet idea please !!!!!!!!!!!!!?
I want a small indoor pet that my mother will let I have please help
I want something cheap easy to take care of and something to hopefully fit in my room
no pet be really easy to take care of .
they all need love and attention , food , proper surroundings etc .
the easy thing would be a fish - but you need to clean the tank weekly , feed it the right amount , etc etc x
have a pet _ easy .
you should treat all pet like child .
they require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up .
if you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster .
I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse , rat , hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold .
fish be probably the easy to take care of though .
French male sensuality ?
_ be date a man from Brittany France for a couple of month now .
_ be away for a week and I be think of wait for he in he apartment wear only he dress shirt .
_ still a fairly new relationship and we _ have sex yet so _ kind of a big deal .
I just _ want to freak he out or make he feel uncomfortable .
be it ok for a woman in French culture to make the first move ?
what do French man find sexy ?
French woman be the one to say yes , the way we say it be not usually as straightforward as you propose to do .
why not wait for he in a sexy dress with lunch or dinner , or a light snack at he house .
and you take it up from there .
just make sure that it be a light meal with little alcohol .
