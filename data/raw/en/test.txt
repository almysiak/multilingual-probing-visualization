what if Google morph into GoogleOS ?
what if Google expand on its search - engine ( and now e-mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ?
[ via Microsoft Watch from Mary Jo Foley ]
( and , by the way , be anybody else just a little nostalgic for the day when that be a good thing ? )
this BuzzMachine post argue that _ rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which _ all hear before , but _ particularly well - put in this post .
Google be a nice search engine .
do anybody use it for anything else ?
they own blogger , of course .
be that a money maker ?
_ stay away from the stock .
I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figure I would put it out there anyways .
John Donovan from Argghhh! have put out a excellent slide show on what be actually find and fight for in Fallujah .
click here to view it .
he make some good observation on a few of the pic .
one of the picture show a flag that be find in Fallujah .
on the next two picture he take screenshot of two beheading video' .
compare the flag to the Fallujah one .
you have to see this slide .... they be amazing .
this Fallujah operation may turn out to be the most important operation do by the US military since the end of the war .
let I join the chorus of annoyance over _ new toolbar , which , as note in the link article , commit just about every sin a online marketer could commit , and make up a few new one besides .
_ not fond of the Google - hate - privacy argument
( you _ need to use they site , you can opt - out of share you information , you _ need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonder -- _ worried that you might send something to someone who would forward a excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on you hand ) .
however , this toolbar be really bad news .
on the other hand , it look pretty cool .
Iran say it be create nuclear energy without want nuclear weapon .
the United State _ believe the Iranian government .
one can suspect the Iranian government .
but there be no proof .
I read a article in Time magazine accuse the Iranian government of be willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the article .
they be certainly be nasty to the United Nation Security Council in connection with the anti-proliferation treaty .
the President have also say he would like to see Israel wipe off the map which he _ even begin to try without nuclear weapon .
but he have insist that he want nuclear power for peaceful purpose .
many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure .
but will diplomacy work ?
and can anyone use military pressure without proof ?
one reader point out that the President watch the American in the embassy when they take they hostage .
he have deny this .
we _ have to believe he .
but we _ prove it .
it do seem that Iranian frequently make statement and then hide behind lack of proof .
angry crowd chant anti-American slogan in the western city of Falluja ( pop. 256000 ) as the security police kill in a friendly fire incident by US troops be bury on Saturday .
Reuters report that " Sunni cleric in the town issue a ' declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemn the death of the security guard and police , announce three day of mourning , and call for a general strike today . "
it read , " the people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which be commit on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah .
let aggressive ( American ) leader and soldier know that we be capable of protect the _ security and safety , and ask they to lift they hand from the city . "
the cleric demand talk with local US commander .
Falluja have long be roil by tense relation with the US soldier there , since local Sunni either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalist or even radical .
city such as Falluja receive special treatment from Saddam and enjoy a disproportionate share of the _ wealth and power .
they know that the American advent imply for they a demotion , and a elevation of the Shiite and Kurd , and they refuse to go quietly .

the Supreme Court announce its ruling today in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld divide along idelogical line with John Roberts abstain due to he involvement at the D.C. Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy join the liberal in a 5 - 3 decision that be 185 page long .
the actual vote be a little confusing .
stay with I now : John Paul STEVENS deliver the opinion of the court with respect to part i through iv , vi through vi - d - iii , vi - d - v , and vii , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER join , and a opinion with respect to part v and vi - d - iv , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER join .
breyer file a concur opinion , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , and GINSBURG join .
KENNEDY file a opinion concur in part , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER join as to part i and ii .
SCALIA file a dissent opinion , in which THOMAS and ALITO join .
THOMAS file a dissent opinion , in which SCALIA join , and in which ALITO join as to all but part i , ii - c - 1 , and iii - b - 2 .
ALITO file a dissent opinion , in which SCALIA and THOMAS join as to part i through iii .
it will take I a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
_ post highlight from the opinion and dissent when _ finished .
important news such as President _ miniscule calibration on he marriage amendment / anti-gay ( update : _ not against gay in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course they relationship should not only be frown upon but should be constitutionally exclude ) have push Sudan not just off the front page , or the a section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
I have to go to the BBC for this report .
_ symptomatic , I suppose , of we fast - pace , 24 hour news - cycle life , that the big short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipse , once we Secretary of State be finished with he whirlwind tour , from the newspaper .
_ just disappointing .
most troubling , however , be the fact that the political will to end the crisis express a few short week ago seem to have ebb .
at that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demand step be take to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hour .
two week late , and the violence continue .
the African Union be clearly not up to the task of keep the peace , pledge 300 troops to a area that will need 15000 , accord to analyst .
and international donor have give only half of the relief aid that Darfur need , accord to the local UN official .
so hear we be , two week late , after that dazzling PR display two week ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appear basically unchanged .
Warren Buffett be give away 85 % of he wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
_ a move that really worry I ; _ usual justification for keep most of he money be that he be still compound the value of he fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gift now would mean significantly less money for the foundation late .
_ a little hard to parse , but at this point he ostensible view be that the Gates be very good money - redistributor , and he want they to have the money as soon as possible .
which essentially sound like _ worried that Bill or Melinda be go to die soon .
I assume he actual reason be that _ worried that Berkshire Hathaway just _ grow quickly enough to justify he usual charity policy .
_ not sure how the market will react .
it _ change the _ intrinsic worth , and as the article note , the company might be add to a major index once the share get more liquid .
on the other hand , this be essentially a statement that the company be overpriced from the guy who know it well -- and happen to be the good investor of the last century .
em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invest in medical research and education , that mean donate now add a tremendous value compare to donate in ten year .
because the 10.000.000 people die from malaria will otherwise be dead .
i.e .
_ not give 85 % away , _ give a number of share each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ? ) .
he mention he _ death have a effect on he .
it sound pretty rational that _ say that Bill and Melinda be at a prime spot , so start the money hose now be a good idea , but Buffet be still keep most of he donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
Bill over at the Fourth Rail have a excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist country in Europe , be basically accept terrorist organization as legitimate form of a political party :
on the same day Palestinian protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas have indicate it will participate in the schedule upcoming parliamentary election .
to the north in Lebanon , there be serious debate within Hezbollah about enter the Lebanese political process in light of _ promise withdrawal .
Syria have agree to withdraw under the condition set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which have already begin .
UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan have indicate it be time to " recognize Hezbollah " after easily be dupe by " the message on the placard they be use " .
this acceptance of blatantly terrorist group as legitimate freedom movement be a cancerous tumor on the United Nation and the media .
over three year after 9-11 , the United Nation , despite they attempt to project strength in fight terrorism , still _ properly define the word " terrorist " , waffle over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilian be terrorist act .
the media routinely obscure the line between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of the New York Times demonstrate .
...
the decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation do not bring peace , but only delay the eventual conflict as the predator of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the international and the media .
_ be fume over this fact for a few week now , ever since some organization and government suggest we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in run Lebanon .
wtf be this ?
this be a terrorist organization plain and simple .
this be the organization that bomb we Marine barracks in 1983 , take American hostage throughout the 80' and now they should be consider a legitimate organization ?
this be just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the European .
the Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , have be among the few Sunni Muslim group willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the American .
it be now threaten to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .
the IIP have also be the main force urge Sunni Arab to participate in the election schedule for January , and have be oppose in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholar .
that the Iraqi Islamic Party be now contemplate leave the Allawi government raise the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the election be in the offing , thus fatally weaken the legitimacy of any new government .
Az - Zaman : the Association of Muslim Scholar forbid Iraqi to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the American .
in a communique , the AMS say that for Iraqi to take part with " raid force " in the assault on a city , the population of which be Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be consider the most mortal of mortal sin .
the Sunni AMS tell Iraqi , " you sin when you participate with occupation force in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah .
remember that the occupation be emphemeral . "
the radical Shiite Sadr movement issue a statement forbid the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .
the statement say , " we direct a appeal at the man in the Iraqi force , whether national guard or other , the majority of whom be Muslim , call upon they to refrain for commit this enormous sin under the banner of force that do not respect we religion or any principle of basic humanity , and we ask they to view this war as illegal . "
it call a " ploy " the assertaion that the attack be merely on foreign fighter at Fallujah .
the convergence of view among the more militant Sunni Muslim cleric of AMS and the radical Shiite of the Sadr movement have be see before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiaman in Najaf .
most Shiite , however , be still reluctant to take major risk to support the Sunni of Fallujah , many of whom have support Saddam and he anti-Shiite pogrom .
President Bush pinch a few nerve yesterday with he choice of word :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
U.S. Muslim group criticize President Bush on Thursday for call a foil plot to blow up airplane part of a " war with Islamic fascist , " say the term could inflame anti-Muslim tension .
U.S. official have say the plot , thwart by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bear many of the hallmark of al Qaeda .
" we believe this be a ill - advise term and we believe that it be counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslim with fascism , " say Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group .
which be why he _ say _ at war with Islamic people .
_ at war with Islamic fascist .
by use the word " Islamic " as a adjective Bush be purposely not associate Muslim with fascism , hence the qualifier .
and if you _ hear by now , the roster of suspect terrorist have not a Tom , Dick or Harry among they :
Umir Hussain , 24 , London E14
Muhammed Usman Saddique , 24 , London E17
Waheed Zaman , 22 , London E17

Abdul Muneem Patel , 17 , London E5
Nabeel Hussain , 21 , Waltham Forest lest you be confused with the suspect from a early plot foil in Canada a few month ago : Fahim Ahmad , 21 , Toronto ;
Zakaria Amara , 20 , Mississauga , Ont. ;
Asad Ansari , 21 , Mississauga ;
Shareef Abdelhaleen , 30 , Mississauga ;

Amin Mohamed Durrani , 19 , Toronto ;
Steven Vikash Chand alias Abdul Shakur , 25 , Toronto ;
Ahmad Mustafa Ghany , 21 , Mississauga ;
Saad Khalid , 19 , of Eclipse Avenue , Mississauga .
_ get a Steven , the one word that _ crash my spell - check , despite it be follow by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur .
folk , if _ Islamic , and fascist , _ a Islamic fascist .
but because we _ want to sound hateful we must pretend _ a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than _ ever be .
on the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declare , " we announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldier , have pledge allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden . "
this pledge be a new development .
Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and he group be say to have be bitter rival of al - Qaeda during the Afghan resistance day .
one witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany allege that Zarqawi have not allow Monotheism and Holy War to share resource with al - Qaeda in the early zero of the 21st century .
if the statement be true , it be a worrying sign that even the divide small radical guerrilla group be be " pick up " by al - Qaeda .
this consolidation be obviously a result of _ aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .
it be a setback for the war on terror .
Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan be a group of only a few hundred " Afghan Arab " who pledge personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden .
it could notionally be expand to encompass the 5000 - strong " 55th Brigade " of the Taliban regime , though this be not the technical definition .
because Usamah be Saudi , my guess be that they be especially influence by a extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominate among _ some 15 million citizen .
in 1998 they be join by Egyptian from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of this be from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ) .
after that point , al - Qaeda be a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremist and the polyglot Arab around Bin Laden , only some of whom be Saudi .
Zarqawi be a Jordanian , and he Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably have a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .
they also have a special connection to some extremist in Jordan and Germany .
they be probably especially orient toward the salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which have a Protestant - like emphasis on go back to the original practice of the early companion of the Prophet Muhammad .
( most Salafi be not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant pietist ) .
Monotheism and Holy War obviously do have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leader of the so - call German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestant do .
another worrisome sign be that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalist oppose to the US presence in Iraq have begin join Monotheism and Holy War , and wear its distinctive orange and black insignia .
this have be sight among Iraqi crowd on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra .
so now there be hundred of al - Qaeda member in Iraq where there have be none before .
the consolidation of small local radical fundamentalist group with al - Qaeda can also be see in the case of the Fizazi group in tangier that morph into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , have member who meet with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta , and ultimately be in part responsible for the Madrid train bombing .
the September 11 Panel will issue its finding on Thursday .
it note 10 point at which the US make key mistake that might have stop Bin _ plot .
four of this be under Clinton and 6 under Bush .
Bush come out today and say that if he have know what be come , he would have expend every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .
this statement be , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel word .
of course Bush would have try to stop 9/11 if he have know it be come .
the question be , " should he have know it be come ? "
the answer be , " yes ! "
we now know that Bush and he administration come into office obsessed with Iraq .
Cheney be look at map of Iraq oil field and mutter about opportunity for US company there , already in January or February of 2001 .
Wolfowitz contradict counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter speak of the al - Qaeda threat , insist that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US come from Iraq , and indicate he accept Laurie _ crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam be behind the 1993 World Trade Tower bombing .
if you believe crackpot theory instead of focus on the reality -- that be a al - Qaeda operation mainly carry out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , a Egyptian terrorist component ally with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .
even after the attack on September 11 , Bush be obsess about Iraq .
Wolfowitz lie to he and say that there be a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq be behind they .
( on what evidence ?
the hijacker be obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational link between al - Qaeda and Iraq have ever be find ) .
Rumsfeld initially reject a attack on al - Qaeda basis in Afghanistan , say there be " no good target " in Afghanistan .
( what about 40 al - Qaeda basis that have train the 9/11 hijacker and other terrorist gun for the United State ?? )
the Pentagon do not even have a plan for deal with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , accord to Bob Woodward .
Bush do not have he eye on the ball .
neither do Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz .
they be play Captain Ahab to _ great white whale .
imperial hubris make the case that lot of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism division elsewhere in the US government know all about Bin Laden and the threat he pose .
they be from all account marginalize and not listen to .
Bush demote Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda expert , from he cabinet .
Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officer , who outrank he , and he could not convince they to go to battle station in the summer of 2001 when George _ hair be " on fire " about the excited chatter the CIA be pick up from radical Islamist terrorist .
as for the Clinton administration , let I say one thing in its defense .
Clinton have work out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allow the US to send a special op team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , base from Pakistan .
I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operation in case anything go wrong .
you also need Pakistani air space .
the plan be all set and could have succeed .
but in fall of 1999 , Gen. Pervez Musharraf make a coup against Nawaz Sharif .
the Pakistani army be rife with element protective of the Taliban , and the new military government renege on the deal .
Musharraf tell Clinton he _ use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .
look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such a operation without Pakistani facility .
of course , you could just go in by main force .
but for that of you tempt in that direction , please look up _ Tabas operation .
it should be easily google .
Clinton try , and try hard .
the god _ with we on that one .
that be how I want you to refer to I as " the king "
I _ think so .

we will have to correct they after the churn .
thank you for you patience .
the Dow top out in February of 1966 at 995 .
by September of that year the Dow have tumble to 744 .
the Dow then rally to a high of 943 in September of '67 .
by March of '68 the Dow have fall to 825 , only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of '68 .
the Dow then sink to 631 in December of '70 .
by April of '71 the Dow have climb back to 950 , only to fall to 869 in February of '72 .
a big rally then take the Dow ( unconfirmed ) to a record high of 1051 in January of '73 , turn everyone bullish .
but by December of '73 the Dow have collapse to 788 .
think that be bad - by December of '74 the Dow have sink to a bear market low of 577 .
at that time , the guru and genius of Wall Street be predict a 250 Dow and many be talk openly about the end of capitalism .
of course , that be the bottom
and _ the way the great bear market since the Depression work its way down .
by late 1974 investor be dizzy , they be desperate , they be wring - out , they have leave Wall Street , many for good .
great , we look forward to see you .

we will forward the draft of that guaranty to you late today .

it look like the Lunar Transportation System , Inc. be visualize a " space highway " go from the moon to Earth ( and back again ) .

" we plan include raise private capital to develop , build , flight test , and operate this Earth - Moon highway for the benefit of the country and the benefit of we investor . "
wise decision to go through the private sector -- _ budget may be kinda tight to fund a project like this .
this group do sound pretty interesting though .
the Lunar Transporatation System ( LTS ) be actually be fund by two space businessman , Walter Kistler and Bob Citron .
both of this man be heavily involved in the private sector of the space industry , and both be also involved with another space company call SPACEHAB .
they want to use LTS to tie into _ vision for space exploration , and seem pleased that the White House be move in that direction .
" we be so excited that the White House and the recent new government space policy underscore the need to involve the private sector in assist NASA develop its plan for the new vision for space exploration , " say Walter Kistler , LTS co-founder and chairman .
with they proposal of a " Earth - Moon " highway , it look like space tourism may become a reality soon than we think .

U.S. astronaut will launch to the moon on sleek , single , shuttle booster rocket and the first new upper - stage rocket this country have develop in more than a decade , NASA and the Pentagon have tell the White House .
lunar lander and other gear need for extended visit to the moon will be loft by gargantuan launcher as big as the Apollo - era Saturn 5 , the most powerful rocket ever fly .
it look as if NASA be transition away from the shuttle model , as in the past they have prove to be quite dangerous as Columbia have recently prove .
although this new rocket be probably more expensive , they will be able to go at a much great range than it shuttle cousin , as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well .
" NASA will initiate development of a crew launch vehicle derive from space shuttle solid rocket booster with a new upper stage for human spaceflight , " say the letter , sign by NASA administrator Mike Griffin and the _ top space official , ex-astronaut Ron Sega ...
" NASA then plan to develop a new 100 - metric - ton - class launch vehicle derive from exist capability with the space shuttle external tank and solid rocket booster for future mission to the moon , " the letter say .
NASA be plan on use this new shuttle to replace the current model , with industry forecaster predict a launch as early as 2014 .
the new rocket design will differ slightly from it predecessor , in the fact that the crew and cargo would launch separately from two different rocket each and join up in space late on .
launch this way will hopefully avoid future disaster , give more support towards NASA revisit the star .

I have a Kodak camera ( 10.2 megapixel ) ... Kodak AF 5x optical lens ... how do I pause it while record ?
you _ ... _ no such thing as " pause " in digital recording .
_ because of the buffer that hold the data until _ ready to be record to the memory card .
when you press the button to stop record the data be move from the buffer to the memory card - no pause .
all you can do be take each section ( individual video ) and edit they together on software .

Michelangelo make the marble one but why do he do another if Donatello have already make one ?

different generation , the donatello be of a boy david as a young sheep herder , the Michelangelo be the grow up man david as slayer and king
because he like make statue of David ! :d
obviously , he should have be arrest and jail - imagine make a statue or paint on the same subject as another artist - clearly insulting and disrespecting - waste time that could have be use make a statue with clothes on .

you be busy , you _ have to sit face to face to try
to make convo , _ short , so if thing go great , you can
extend , and if you want to end it , you just say bye ,

my favorite place ...
my daughter and I stay here again from the 7th to the 14th of December .
yet again it be a great stay from beginning to end .
okay we room be at time noisy but we be in a mega busy city at a extremely busy time of year .
a definite no
incompetent server , kitchen and management .
expect either undercook or mushy food and lackluster service .
the investor put big buck into the building but be clueless about what make a good dining or bar experience .
even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at _ .
wonderful atmosphere
I have be go there since I be a little girl and love the friendly and relaxing atmosphere .
Dr. Stiefvater have always be very professional and helpful .
I would recommend Bayside Chiropractic to anyone who be in need of a regular adjustment or be suffer from a chronic condition .
channel guide
believe it or not , but the channel guide have be most helpful to my family member that visit and _ know where to start when it come to watch satellite tv .
I just give they guide and they can find anything they need .

Michael help shoot the majority of my _ website and we could not have be happy .
we go through six photographer to find the right photographer that would represent we firm in the light we wish to and Michael and he team make that happen .
_ worth every penny .
average food and deathly slow service
I have eat here several time and every time the service be slow than slow .
one time we even leave after sit at the table for 20 minute and not be greet with a drink order .
ridiculous .
there must be a good Mexican place in Rockland .
I be in love with the giant plate of nacho !
last time I go however , my beer be warm and the service be so - so .
I get that careless teenager kind of treatment from some of they staff ... perhaps they should hire more serious adult to help serve / cook .
nice friendly local bagel place
there might be big and more well know bagel place in the area but Family Bagel be nice people , small shop and incredibly friendly .
while other may be ok wait in line at Town Bagel we be happy with the quality and service we get at Family Bagel
very mediocre donut !
the donut be very over proofed , make they stale and bready .
the service be friendly and fast , but this just _ make up for the lack - luster product .
we try 4 different style of donut , they be all the same when it come to quality .
a staple !
I live in the neighborhood and this place be one of my favorite for a tasty , quick and inexpensive meal .
branch out and try something other than the Pad Thai , the curry be fantastic .
fast and friendly service , they know my order when I walk in the door !
on time , clean and very nice
I call over the weekend due to clog kitchen sink .
schedule appointment for 8:30 Monday morning .
Rich be here before the schedule time .
he be very clean , very nice to work with and give a very reasonable price .
